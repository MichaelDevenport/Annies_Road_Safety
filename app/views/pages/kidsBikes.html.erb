  					<p class="beta-p left">Make eye contact with other road users. Maintain a straight line and donâ€™t pass on the left hand side.</p>
						<p class="beta-p left">Use hand signals and a bell. Ride at least one metre from parked cars. Use the cycle or traffic lane.</p>
						<p class="beta-p left">Always make your intentions clear to other road users. Using simbolic gestures like when turning a corner or stopping is the key here and just using your common sense is where it's at.</p>
